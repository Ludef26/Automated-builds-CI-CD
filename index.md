## What is CI?

CI means continuous integration and this name is given to the set of processes of building, testing and merging the different changes that occur in a code over the course of one or several days.

By doing all these processes automatically thanks to tools like Github Actions, the developer has the guarantee that his code will be built in a safe way and he will have time to invest in other more important processes of his project.
